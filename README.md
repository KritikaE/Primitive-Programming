Developed a simple compiler using Python. It Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Operates with a wide variable set (a to z and A to Z) to simplify the processing logic.
Performs essential lexical and syntactic analysis to interpret user-defined expressions.
Demonstrates core principles of compiler design, including:
a. Tokenization
b. Expression parsing
c. Execution of operations
Designed to provide a minimal yet functional model for understanding compiler fundamentals.
Intended as a starting point for students and beginners in the field of programming language design.
Prioritizes conceptual clarity and hands-on learning over complex features.
